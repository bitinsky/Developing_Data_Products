# JunoFest
The [Junos](https://junoawards.ca/) are Canada's own music awards, and [Junofest](https://www.facebook.com/JUNOfest/) is the musical celebration that occurs before the actual award show.

This is a map of all the JunoFest venues this year (2020)

  iconAnchorX = 31*215/230/2, iconAnchorY = 16
